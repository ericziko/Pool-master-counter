// Local LAN relay for Pool Master Counter's "Group Session" feature.
//
// This server is deliberately dumb about pool rules - it only serves the
// existing static web app (unmodified) and relays JSON messages between
// one "host" browser tab and any number of "guest" tabs connected over
// WebSocket. The host keeps running the app's real game logic exactly as
// it does offline; it just also broadcasts its state after every save and
// executes a small whitelist of "please call this function" requests from
// guests. See js/app.js (networkMode/openRelayConnection/dispatchNetworkAction)
// for the client side of this protocol.
//
// LAN-only, no auth, no TLS - meant for a trusted local WiFi (e.g. a pool
// hall), not the public internet. Do not port-forward this.
