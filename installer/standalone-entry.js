//
// Static files are served from assets embedded in the binary itself
// (via node:sea's getAsset/getAssetKeys - see generate-sea-config.js for
// how those get embedded) instead of from disk, since there's no repo
// checkout on the end user's machine at all. The app has no server-side
// routing of its own - every screen is a client-side hash fragment
// (#leaderboard, #group-session, ...) that never reaches the server - so
// unlike a typical SPA server there's no need for a catch-all fallback to
// index.html; an exact asset-key match (with "/" mapped to "index.html")
// is the whole story, same as what express.static effectively does today.
